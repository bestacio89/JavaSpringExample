### Dockerfile

the  Dockerfile is designed to build and run your Spring Boot application. It does not directly depend on Kafka or any specific database. Instead, the applicationâ€™s configuration (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`) determines which services it connects to.

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file sets up the entire environment, including Kafka, PostgreSQL, and other services. You can start the services you need by running `docker-compose up`.

### Application Configuration

Your Spring Boot application will use the configuration provided in the `docker-compose.yml` to connect to the correct database and other services. This is typically done through environment variables or configuration files in your Spring Boot application.

### Running with Docker Compose

To run your application with Docker Compose, use the following steps:

1. **Navigate to the `docker` Directory:**

   ```sh
   cd path/to/project-root/docker
   ```

2. **Build and Start the Containers:**

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Run Database Migrations:**

   To apply database migrations using Flyway, run:

   ```sh
   docker-compose run --rm app mvn flyway:migrate
   ```

### Choosing the Database

You can select the database your application uses by adjusting the `application.properties` or `application.yml` configuration in your Spring Boot application.

#### Example Configuration for PostgreSQL:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/mydatabase
spring.datasource.username=myuser
spring.datasource.password=bl@dg3r$$
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

#### Example Configuration for MariaDB:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://mariadb:3306/mydatabase
spring.datasource.username=myuser
spring.datasource.password=bl@dg3r$$
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

#### Example Configuration for SQL Server:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://sqlserver:1433;databaseName=mydatabase
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=bl@dg3r$$
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

### README for Your Colleagues

```markdown
# Docker Environment Setup

This directory contains the Docker Compose configuration for setting up multiple services including MongoDB, Zookeeper, Kafka, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, and the Spring Boot application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

## Steps to Run the Services

1. **Navigate to the `docker` Directory:**

   ```sh
   cd path/to/project-root/docker
   ```

2. **Build and Start the Containers:**

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Run Database Migrations:**

   ```sh
   docker-compose run --rm app mvn flyway:migrate
   ```

4. **Run Tests:**

   ```sh
   docker-compose run app mvn test
   ```

5. **Stop the Containers:**

   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Configuration

The database connection details are set in the `docker-compose.yml` file. You can modify them as needed. The data for MongoDB, Kafka, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and SQL Server is persisted in Docker volumes to ensure data is not lost when containers are stopped.

## Additional Information

For any issues or questions, please refer to the Docker and Docker Compose documentation or reach out to a team member.
```

### Summary

With this setup:
- Your Spring Boot application can run independently of Kafka or any specific database by selecting the appropriate configuration.
- Docker Compose manages the required services and ensures they are correctly configured.
- The instructions in the README guide your colleagues through setting up and managing the environment, ensuring consistency and ease of use.

This approach provides flexibility and makes it easy to switch between different databases or run additional services like Kafka as needed.
